#OKCoders Javascript Project Framework

###Instructions
Everything you want to edit is in the `javascripts directory`. `1_1.html` is project 1, exercise 1. `1_2.html` is project 2,
exercise 2, and so on. The comment in the `<script>` block should make it pretty clear where you want to write stuff.

When you're ready to go, just run `node app.js` from the `babys-first-node` directory.
